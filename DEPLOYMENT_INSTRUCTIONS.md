## üìù Step-by-Step Deployment

### STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Open https://github.com/new
2. Fill in repository details:
   - **Repository name:** `daily-automation` (or your choice)
   - **Description:** "Daily automated repository updates using GitHub Actions"
   - **Public/Private:** Choose your preference
3. **DO NOT** initialize with README or .gitignore (we have our own)
4. Click **"Create repository"**
5. Copy the repository URL (format: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME`)

---

### STEP 2: Initialize Local Git Repository

Open PowerShell and navigate to the project directory:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\Asus\Desktop\poopee
git init
```

Configure git (one-time setup):
```powershell
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

---

### STEP 3: Add All Files to Git

```powershell
git add .
```

Verify files are staged:
```powershell
git status
```

Expected output:
```
On branch main/master
Changes to be committed:
  new file:   .github/workflows/daily-commit.yml
  new file:   .gitignore
  new file:   README.md
  new file:   activity.log
  new file:   IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
  new file:   WORKFLOW_SETUP_GUIDE.md
  new file:   VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md
  new file:   FILE_STRUCTURE.md
```

---

### STEP 4: Create Initial Commit

```powershell
git commit -m "Initial commit: GitHub Actions daily update workflow with email 21f3000813@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"
```

Verify commit:
```powershell
git log --oneline
```

---

### STEP 5: Connect Remote Repository

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `REPO_NAME` with your actual values:

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
```

Verify remote:
```powershell
git remote -v
```

Expected output:
```
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git (push)
```

---

### STEP 6: Rename Branch to Main (if needed)

```powershell
git branch -M main
```

---

### STEP 7: Push to GitHub

```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

You may be prompted to authenticate. Use:
- **GitHub username:** your GitHub username
- **Password/Token:** Personal Access Token (if 2FA enabled)

Verify push was successful - no error messages should appear.

---

### STEP 8: Verify Files on GitHub

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Appearing in Actions

**Issue:** Can't see the workflow in the Actions tab

**Solution:**
1. Wait 1-2 minutes after push
2. Refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
3. Verify `.github/workflows/daily-commit.yml` is in repository
4. Check file is valid YAML (no syntax errors)

### Workflow Fails with Authentication Error

**Issue:** "Permission denied" or authentication error in push step

**Solution:**
1. Go to repository **Settings** ‚Üí **Actions** ‚Üí **General**
2. Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
3. Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
4. Save changes
5. Re-run workflow

### Commit Not Appearing

**Issue:** Workflow completed but no new commit visible

**Solution:**
1. Verify `permissions: contents: write` in workflow
2. Check branch name is correct (should be `main`)
3. Look for workflow errors in logs
4. Re-run workflow manually

### Email Not in Commit

**Issue:** Commit shows wrong email or author

**Solution:**
1. Verify git config in workflow is correct
2. Check email is: `21f3000813@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
3. Verify git config step runs before commit step
